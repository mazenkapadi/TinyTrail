# TinyTrail - A Smart URL Shortener

**TinyTrail** is a smart, scalable URL shortening service built with **Rust** and **Google Firestore**. It allows users to shorten long URLs with customizable expiration policies and provides a sleek, minimalistic interface for ease of use. Whether you need short URLs for quick sharing, limited-time offers, or permanent references, TinyTrail has you covered!

## üîß Features

- **Flexible Expiration Options**:
  - Short URLs valid for **24 hours** with up to **3 accesses**.
  - Short URLs valid for **7 days** with unlimited accesses.
  - Short URLs valid **forever**.
  
- **Smart Algorithm**:
  - Generates unique and compact short IDs using the **UUID v4 algorithm** combined with an 8-character truncation for brevity.
  - Efficient Firestore integration ensures high-speed reads and writes, automatically creating collections and documents as needed.
  - Dynamically checks expiration and access limits during URL resolution.
  
- **Minimalist UI**:
  - Clean and monochromatic design for focus and simplicity.
  - Three distinct buttons for creating URLs with different expiration policies.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **URL Shortening**:
   - Users provide a long URL via the frontend.
   - The backend generates a short ID using `UUID` and associates it with the provided URL and expiration details in **Firestore**.

2. **URL Resolution**:
   - When a short URL is accessed, the backend:
     - Looks up the short ID in Firestore.
     - Checks if the URL is valid (not expired and access limits not exceeded).
     - Redirects to the original URL or returns an appropriate error.

3. **Algorithm Highlights**:
   - **Compact IDs**: Short IDs are generated by truncating `UUID v4` to 8 characters, reducing URL length while maintaining uniqueness.
   - **Firestore Optimization**: No explicit collection creation; Firestore automatically handles collections and documents during write operations.
   - **Scalable Architecture**: Rust‚Äôs high performance and Firestore‚Äôs distributed infrastructure ensure the system can handle millions of requests seamlessly.
